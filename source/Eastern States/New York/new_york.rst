  monetary gain which was founded by **Peter Minuit** in 1626. New Netherlands, 
  which comprised some areas of present-day New York, were regarded by the 
  Dutch as an important source of fur and until 1664 when Dutch surrendered to 
  the colony to the English and renamed it as **New York**, New York was 
  known as a New Amsterdam due to Dutch arrivals.
